# Shyft

A tool to make moving files simpler

## TODO

Features and things that need doing:

* Deploy site somewhere
* Drag and drop files
* Parametrise F.E.  E.G. URL
* Limit Max number of files in the UI.
* Build and deploy pipeline
* Animation for new files
* UI design
* Add help text
* Add FAQ
* Extend Sessions
* End Sessions
* Hide QR Code
* Debug why files get deleted from s3 - Seems that FileUploaded is called at other times.

## WebSocket Protocol (v0)

MessageName (Type) (Permission: Host/Secondary) (Source: Server/Client)

All messages are in json format and contain a field type which corresponds to each message below. Some messages have other fields.

To support clients without websockets there are plans to create a separate http protocol.

## HTTP Protocol

To make upload and download progress bars simpler uploading and downloading is done using simple http by interacting directly with S3.

### Get Session

** Not Implemented in initial version**

### Get File List

** Not Implemented in initial version**

** Not Implemented in initial version**

#### Upload Init 

** Not Implemented in initial version**

## String representation of binary ids

Convert the binary value to hex

## Url Structure

shyft.to -> redirects to shyftto.com

`shyftto.com` - static html content
`ws.shyftto.com` - all websockets
`files.shyftto.com` - all file transfers

## Deploying Server

First Package server

```
sam package --output-template-file packaged.yaml --s3-bucket shyfttemplates
```

Next Deploy Changes

```
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file /home/conor/shyft/server/packaged.yaml --stack-name testshyft --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM 
```
